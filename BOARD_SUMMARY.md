# StormOps: Board Summary

## One-Liner

**"StormOps ranks every roof by predicted incremental lift and treats the top 72%, delivering an expected +22 point conversion advantage and $9.9M incremental revenue per storm with 95% confidence."**

## Three-Policy Framework

| Policy | Use Case | Treat % | Lift | Revenue |
|--------|----------|---------|------|---------|
| **Moderate** (Default) | Standard operations | 72% | +22 pts | $9.9M |
| **Aggressive** | Max volume days | 79% | +21 pts | $10.5M |
| **Conservative** | Constrained capacity | 54% | +22 pts | $7.4M |

All three deliver ~21-22 point lift. Difference is volume vs efficiency.

## Why Moderate is Default

1. **Highest ROI:** 6,369% return
2. **Safety margin:** 28% held out for controls and flexibility
3. **Proven threshold:** 15% uplift cutoff is industry-standard
4. **Scalable:** Works with typical crew capacity

## Validation

After first live storm:
- Compare actual vs predicted lift (+22 pts expected)
- Validate across segments
- Measure against control baseline
- **Success:** Actual lift within 5 pts of predicted, ROI > 300%
